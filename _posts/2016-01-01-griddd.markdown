Inspired by Reddit's /r/place, Griddd is an 8x8 grid which users alter by connecting points with colored lines. Each creation is temporal, in that other users have the ability to edit the grid, with updates and alterations refreshing the grid in real-time. Send the page to a friend and create something together.

NOTE: Griddd is currently hosted on a demo server. Please allow ~30 seconds loading time, as the server puts itself to sleep after a small duration of inactivity.
