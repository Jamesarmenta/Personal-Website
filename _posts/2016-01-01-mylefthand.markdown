Handwriting has always been a sore subject for me. Even as an adult, I often feel embarrassed writing letters, thank you cards or love notes. I wish I could use pencil and pen like an artisan, crafting smooth letters onto paper with ease.
<br><br>
Instead of attempting to replicate the many calligraphers that I idolize, I have chosen to work on embracing my unique penmanship (or lack thereof). To do so, I created a batch of prints that focus on the irregularity of my handwriting. Although I am right-handed, each phrase was written with my left hand to accentuate my misshapen characters.
